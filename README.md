# Airline Operations and Passenger Insights Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard analyzing airline operations and passenger insights, highlighting trends in flight landings, cargo volumes, demographics, and punctuality to support data-driven decisions in the airline industry.

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of airline operations and passenger demographics, leveraging two datasets to reveal trends in flight landings, cargo volumes, passenger profiles, and flight punctuality. Designed to aid airline industry stakeholders and airport management, the dashboard enables data-driven decision-making across key areas of air traffic and customer insights.

## Key Features
- **Flight Operations Analysis**: Visualizes landing counts by airline and aircraft type, geographic distribution of landings, and total landed weight by aircraft model and manufacturer, offering insights into air traffic patterns and cargo capacities.
- **Passenger Demographics and Insights**: Explores age distribution, nationality, and passenger volume by origin, with in-depth views on demographic trends for targeted service improvements.
- **Flight Punctuality Tracking**: Analyzes flight delays by airport and over time, identifying patterns and highlighting airports with frequent delays.
- **Interactive Filters and Drill-Throughs**: Provides slicers, tooltips, and drill-through options for in-depth exploration of each metric, allowing users to focus on specific airlines, regions, or demographics.

## Research Questions Addressed
1. **What are the trends in landing counts and cargo volumes across different regions and airlines?**
2. **What are the demographic profiles and origins of passengers, and how do these insights impact airline services?**
3. **How does flight punctuality vary across airports and over time?**

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for operational insights and strategic planning in the airline industry.
